> library for Haskell-style strings in JavaScript - so bad it'll make you hiss

**hss.js** brings Haskell-style "a string is a list of characters" thinking to JavaScript:

```js
new Hss('hello')
// Hss { value: [ 'h', 'e', 'l', 'l', 'o' ] }
```

astral symbols are counted as just one character:

```js
new Hss('hi ðŸ˜„')
// Hss { value: [ 'h', 'i', ' ', 'ðŸ˜„' ] }
```

## disclaimer
this package is stupid. it should work, but it's really stupid.\
it does not implement several methods which we judged as unnecessary, such as `String#replaceAll` or `Array#copyWithin`.\
it also uses `Array#findLastIndex`, a method compatible only with fairly recent browser and Node.js versions, and does not provide a polyfill.\
**use at your own risk.**

## install
```
$ npm install hss.js
```
